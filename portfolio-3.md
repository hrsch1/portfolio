These sweatpants were 100% made from scratch using some of my favorite measurements from past pants I've created. I purchased this the material when I was on vacation in Indonesia visiting family, and I have created many pairs of pants with this material. I have incorporated this material into other projects as well such as using for lining and hybrid material pants.
